Easily create a custom URL to redirect visitors to view random posts or home page for wordpress. Keyboard hotkey shortcuts also available for browsing random posts.Add functions based on randompost

== Description ==

Keep visitors on your website longer and get more traffic on your website by inviting your visitors to read random posts! It's easy! Just install the randomPost plugin, and select the random URL slug you want to use. This URL slug will redirect your users to a random post of yours. You can set the probability of random to the home page or content page. We recommend using the word "random" as your URL slug, but the option exists to use any slug you'd like. Once configured, add the new URL with the slug to your menu as a custom link. That alone will invite visitors to stick around. 

To add on top of that, we've added a configurable hotkey! If a visitor presses R on their keyboard, it'll automatically load a random post! You can change the hotkey to be any key you'd like. To add a little more fun to your website, put a notice telling visitors to "Press R to read a random post".
